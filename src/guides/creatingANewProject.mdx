# Creating a New Project

_Optional_: Create a board on [Asana](https://app.asana.com/) to keep you organized.

## Concept
It's important to actually know what it is that your app or project should do. Don't just make something. Start with a goal, or a vision of an idea and flesh it out during this process.

Once you have an idea, write down some key words that help to illustrate your goal.

## Branding

---

### Name
Use [namelix](https://namelix.com) to help you in creating a name. Also save any good themeing colors / logos you like.

### NPM

If you intend to use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to host your package, it's important that you make sure another package doesn't already exist with the same name.

### Logo

Use [brandmark](https://app.brandmark.io/v2/) to help with logo creation.

### Tagline

Use [shopify's slogan maker tool](https://www.shopify.com/tools/slogan-maker/) to help you come up with a catchy tagline. Some of them*really*don't work well, so dig deep or use another tool.

### Icon

Use [the noun project](https://thenounproject.com/) to come up with icons to use in your design.

### Font

Use [Adobe Typekit](https://typekit.com) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to find free fonts.

### Colors

Use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to help you find a color pallette that you like.

### Favicon

Use [real favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) to generate your favicon from a png. Make sure the file is a perfect square, and at least 260px x 260px.

### Header Images and Other Logos

Use [unDraw](https://undraw.co) for free svg's to use in other parts of your project.

#### Exporting as SVG (Font Issue)

When exporting as SVG in AI, make sure you:

1. Select All

2. Go to Object -> Expand

3. In the Export Dialog, under the Font section, select Create Outlines

## Documentation / Landing Page

## Notifications

Use [beamer](https://www.getbeamer.com/) to notify your users.
